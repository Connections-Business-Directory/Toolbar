Adds useful admin links and resources for the Connections Business Directory plugin to the WordPress Toolbar / Admin Bar.

== Description ==

This is an extension plugin for the [Connections Business Directory Plugin](http://wordpress.org/plugins/connections/). Quick click access without having to scroll to all of Connections admin pages from either the admin or the front end for easy management. You can even go to a specific settings tab of filter the entry list with a single click making you life easier.

What not just include this with the plugin as an option? Two reasons, the admin bar has limited space and to limit the amount of core plugin options and code.

== Installation ==

Extract the zip file and just drop the contents in the wp-content/plugins/ directory of your WordPress installation and then activate the Plugin from Plugins page.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
